 abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the integration of eyetracking and a Brain-Computer Interface into an Augmented Reality system to control a smart home environment. Through a head-mounted display, we present context-dependent control elements which the user selects by directing attention towards them. We show that the combination of both modalities leads to the most robust detection of selections and an interface which is accepted by its users.},
